# sitemap-check

This cli tool will parse your XML sitemaps and issue a `HEAD` request to URLs they contain and warn you against problems such as invalid XML or unreachable pages.
If you give it a sitemap index URL which contains other sitemaps, it will parse all of them.

## Usage

```bash
$ sitemap-check http://url-to-your-sitemap
```
